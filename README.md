# ThriveAutistic
I wish the autistic community had a way to coalesce around solutions, accommodations, and ways of existing that work best for us, and a way to share those with each other and back them up with resources and data. This is an attempt to fulfill this wish.

## Getting Started - Frontend
The default build tooling uses docker for maximum portability across systems.

### Install dependencies
There are only two dependencies: `docker` and `make`. We assume that both of them have been installed and are accessible from the command line.

### Run the development server
```
make start
```

### Build the production site
```
make build
```

### Run the production server
```
make start-prod
```
